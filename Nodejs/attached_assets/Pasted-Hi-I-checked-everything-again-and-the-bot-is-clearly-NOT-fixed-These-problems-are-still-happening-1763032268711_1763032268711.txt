Hi,
I checked everything again and the bot is clearly NOT fixed.

These problems are still happening:
	•	Live market prices are not updating
	•	Current price shows “–” for all pairs
	•	Unrealized P/L is not calculating
	•	The bot is opening and closing trades instantly at the exact same price ($0 profit)
	•	Confidence % shows but no real logic behind execution
	•	The backend is not connected properly to a live price feed
	•	The bot stopped trading by itself
	•	Orders with “entry = exit” make zero sense and show something is broken

All of this is caused by your code, not by me.

You were already paid to fix this, so do NOT charge me again for the same issue.
Please fix the bot properly and make sure it is using a real trading strategy, real price feed, and correct API connection.

Here is the strategy I want you to implement — it is a stable and proven trading strategy that actually works in real markets:

📌 BEST STRATEGY (use exactly this):
EMA + RSI Trend Strategy

BUY conditions:
	•	Price is above 200 EMA (trend is bullish)
	•	RSI crosses above 30 (coming out of oversold)
	•	Volume is above last 20-period average (confirm momentum)

SELL conditions:
	•	Price is below 200 EMA (trend is bearish)
	•	RSI crosses below 70 (coming out of overbought)
	•	Volume confirms move

Risk Management:
	•	Stop Loss: 1.5%
	•	Take Profit: 3–5%
	•	Minimum hold time: 5–15 minutes (NO instant open-close trades)
	•	No back-to-back scalping at the same candle
	•	Bot must wait for clear confirmation signals

Additional rules:
	•	No trade during low volatility (less than 1.5% movement)
	•	No trade unless price feed is working
	•	No trade unless indicators are valid
	•	Bot must show: entry price, exit price, real P/L, and live unrealized P/L

This is a simple, reliable, and profitable strategy that ALL real bots use.

Please fix the bot correctly using this strategy and ensure everything works as expected before asking for any additional payment.
This is your responsibility since the issues are coming from your implementation.

Thank you.
