Add a 5-day free trial period for all new users who join via Telegram.

1) Trial settings
- In index.js (or the main bot handler), define:
  const TRIAL_DAYS = 5; // length of free trial
  const TRIAL_PLAN = "trial";

2) When a user sends /start (with or without referral code):
- If the user does not already exist in users.json, create a new record:
  {
    chat_id,
    username,
    first_name,
    plan: TRIAL_PLAN,
    referred_by: <partner code if provided>,
    created_at: nowISO(),
    expires_at: addDays(now, TRIAL_DAYS)
  }
- Reply:
  “👋 Welcome to Arben’s Crypto Signals!
   You now have a FREE 5-day trial.
   You’ll receive live BUY/SELL alerts until your trial expires on <expiry_date>.
   After that, visit the shop or contact support to extend your access.”

3) On every signal broadcast:
- Only send to users where expires_at > now (same as active plan logic).

4) On expiry:
- When a user’s trial expires, send an automated Telegram message once:
  “⏳ Your free trial has ended.
   Renew at the shop or contact us to keep receiving crypto alerts.”
  (Add a flag user.trial_notified=true to avoid repeat messages.)

5) /status command:
- Show:
  - Plan name (e.g. “trial” or “basic”)
  - Expiry date (formatted)
  - Remaining days
  - If trial: add line “You’re in a free trial that ends on <date>.”

6) Admin/Partner actions:
- Existing /api/user/activate still upgrades trial users to paid plans.
- When activated, overwrite plan/expires_at normally.

7) Utility helpers:
- Add addDays(dateISO, n) helper (returns new ISO date).
- Ensure expired users are automatically excluded from active alerts.

8) Optional config:
- Store TRIAL_DAYS in process.env.TRIAL_DAYS if present (override default 5).
- Log in console whenever a new trial is created:
  `[Trial] Started 5-day trial for chat_id=<id> (expires <date>)`

9) Docs:
- Update README.md and ALERTS.md:
  • "Trial Mode" section explaining 5-day auto trial for new users.
  • How to convert trial → paid via /api/user/activate.
  • How to change trial length (edit TRIAL_DAYS).
  • Reminder message format.

10) Verify + deploy:
- Test:
  • New user presses Start → gets trial message with expiry.
  • /status shows correct trial info.
  • After expiry, receives end-of-trial message.
  • /api/users?active=1 only lists unexpired users.
  • Activation upgrades correctly.
- Keep all existing partner/referral, alert, and dashboard features working.
